After submission
- navbar component
- limit what info is sent to a component from the store to only the info that component will need
    - const mapStateToProps = state => {
            return {lists: state.lists}
        }
- add border to all images of books
    - could use css
        - img {

        }
    - could add styling inline to image elements and components
- add warning to delete page
- handle display of lists with only 1 book on all lists
- backspace is not recognized on Autocomplete section of form as a way to delete the last option in the list
- handle input errors (such as naming a new list the same thing as an old one or as "All Books" in particular)
- combine reducers
    - https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers
- handle data separation of lists to lists / standard_lists / all_books_list on the backend instead of the frontend
    - This should be ablel to done with the index action in lists_controller.rb
