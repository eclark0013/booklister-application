- edit page for lists
- delete option for books and lists 
- redirect to book page after finishing an edit or creating a new book
- handle input errors (such as naming a new list the same thing as an old one or as "All Books" in particular)
- route "/books" to a List page of all books
    - on the list page when you are finding which list to display (presumably based on list_id), check for id and if there is none, set the default to be the all_books
